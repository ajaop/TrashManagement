# Overview
The Trash Management App is designed to address the growing waste management challenges in Nigeria by ensuring waste is properly and efficiently disposed of. The app provides an easy-to-use platform where users can request waste collection services, either as a one-off or on a recurring basis (weekly, monthly, or yearly). By connecting users with reliable waste management providers, we aim to reduce improper waste disposal, improve environmental cleanliness, and contribute to a healthier living environment.

# Key Features
1. **One-Time Pickup:** Users can request a one-time waste pickup when needed, providing flexibility for those who require occasional service.
2. **Recurring Pickup Plans:** Users can opt for weekly, monthly, or yearly waste collection plans, ensuring regular waste disposal without the hassle of rebooking each time.
3. **Secure Payments & Refunds:** Payments are processed securely within the app. In case of any issues with the waste collection (e.g., missed pickup), users are guaranteed a full refund, ensuring transparency and trust.
4. **User-Friendly Interface:** The app is designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy for anyone to request and manage their waste disposal services.
